Hey all,

I'm happy to announce the new version of <a href="http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector">CSS Browser Selector</a>. This new version includes two more browser codes, ff2 and ff3 for Firefox versions two and three respectively.

Another news is the <a href="http://latimes.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/css_browser_selector/trunk">CSS Browser Selector Ruby on Rails Plugin</a>!

<a href="http://geminstallthat.wordpress.com/">Reid MacDonald</a> wrote a Rails plugin which handle the browser detection and put css browser selector codes in html on server side, so it works even if javascript is disabled.

Take a look at <a href="http://latimes.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/css_browser_selector/trunk/README">README</a> file to understand what this plugin do.

Thanks very much
