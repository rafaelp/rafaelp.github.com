<blockquote>Commercial pressures of today's economy result in                 imposed deadlines being the norm for technology                 projects. Yet the nature of software projects                 demands that teams deal with the constant dynamics                 of change. This creates extreme degrees of project                 risk and perpetuates the so-called "software                 crisis," whereby a large percentage of projects are                 canceled, delivered late, over budget, and/or poor                 quality. However, knowing the nature of these                 dynamics empowers managers to make decisions on                 promised functionality, thereby controlling the                 very factors that degrade software quality and                 reliability.</blockquote>
